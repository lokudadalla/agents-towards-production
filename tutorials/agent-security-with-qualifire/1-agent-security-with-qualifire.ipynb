    "# Agent Security with Qualifire üî•\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "As AI agents become more prevalent in production systems, ensuring their safety and reliability becomes critical. This notebook demonstrates how to implement robust security guardrails for AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "- AI agents can be vulnerable to various attacks and misuse\n",
    "- Production deployments need comprehensive security controls\n",
    "- Manual implementation of security measures is complex and error-prone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "- Automated protection against prompt injections\n",
    "- Content safety filtering\n",
    "- Hallucination detection and prevention  \n",
    "- Policy compliance enforcement\n",
    "- Easy integration with existing AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll build a simple chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4.1 (can by any LLM), then secure it using Qualifire's two main approaches:\n",
    "1. Gateway - For API-level protection\n",
    "2. SDK - For fine-grained control within your application\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÑπÔ∏è You can use any LLM you'd like. For this tutorial, we'll use OpenAI's GPT-4.1. If you want to read the specific configurations for each LLM, check out the [documentation](https://docs.qualifire.ai?utm=agents-towards-production)."
